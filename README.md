# SSBU Modding

## Purpose

To create a workspace that will facilitate developing mods for Super Smash Bros Ultimate. 
Currently geared towards Smashline 2. 

## Assumptions

1. A Unix-based OS. I use Windows Subsystem Linux with Ubuntu exclusively for programming, and if you wish to pursue programming as a job, you'll need to learn Linux eventually.
2. You have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed, as that's our language of choice for developing mods.
3. You have [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) installed, so you can interact with the `Taskfile`.
4. You have `git`, for reasons that should be known.
5. You have `curl` (should come with Unix and Windows).

## How to install 

It's as simple as running 

```bash
task
``` 
No extra arguments needed. That will run the `default` task dedicated to installing everything for you. 

If you encounter a failure anywhere in the installation process and want to redo the 
installation in it's entirely, simply run: 

```bash
task default --force
```

If you want to perform each step one at a time, all available tasks are available with:

```bash
task --list
```

## Post install file breakdown

### Dumps

#### SSBU-Dumped-Scripts

Contains all matters of attributes that make up a fighter's actions. Effects, expressions,
sounds, active hitbox data, etc. These are the files you'd go to if you're looking to 
change things such as how a fighter's move works or setting global rules all fighters 
abide by (i.e. turbo mode.)

#### SSBU-Dumped-Motion-Lists

View the decompiled `motion_list.bin` files for every character as `motion_list.yml`
files. Especially useful when you want to do things like port moves from different 
characters, or add moves into a character's repetoire.

Just keep in mind that you already contain the decompiled `motion_list.bin` file thanks 
to this dump.

### Rust files

#### `cpp.rs` source file 

Think of it like a header file in C++, containing all function definitions available to 
you.

#### `lua_const.rs` source file

A hashmap / dictionary of every constant value in SSBU.

#### `tale_const.rs` source file

A global table for various attributes regarding a fighter's current / past status.

### `CSV` files 

#### `animation_animcmd*.csv`

Contains a list of all animation names, as well as their in-game animcd equivalents.

#### `ParamLabels.csv` hash list 

Contains almost every single hash value in SSBU. Special moves, camera effects, backgrounds,
etc.
