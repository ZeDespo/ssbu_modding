# SSBU Modding

## Purpose

To create a workspace that will facilitate developing mods for Super Smash Bros Ultimate. 
Currently geared towards Smashline 2. 

## Assumptions

1. A Unix-based OS. I use Windows Subsystem Linux with Ubuntu exclusively for programming, and if you wish to pursue programming as a job, you'll need to learn Linux eventually.
2. You have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed, as that's our language of choice for developing mods.
3. You have [Task](https://taskfile.dev/installation/) installed, so you can interact with the `Taskfile`.
4. You have `git`, for reasons that should be known.
5. You have `curl` (should come with Unix and Windows).

## How to install 

It's as simple as running 

```bash
task
``` 
No extra arguments needed. That will run the `default` task dedicated to installing everything for you. 

If you encounter a failure anywhere in the installation process and want to redo the 
installation in it's entirely, simply run: 

```bash
task default --force
```

If you want to perform each step one at a time, all available tasks are available with:

```bash
task --list
```
